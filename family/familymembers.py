class FamilyMember():
    """creates the family member information: firstname, lastname, date of birth, (SSN)? see notes for more examples"""


















































"""Notes:

Categories: Each family member will have basic information like name, dob, ssn, etc.
then, other things that are possible to add can be a categorical add, like, school, work, meds, doctors information,
etc, think like, drop down box, where the user "adds" each chunk of info.  Add/delete family members for functionality. Family relationship.

profile? well, each family member can have their own login, i guess? we'll worry about that later.

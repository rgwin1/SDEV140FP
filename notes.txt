things to consider:

Each section will need to be able to store the current state, 
otherwise when the page is called again upon button click, 
it will be a fresh page with no previous data.

Navigation history:

consider a back button, 
'navigation stack' will need to be stored in some way

notes to self:

struggling with getting the dashboard window to stretch to fill the entirety of window_frame
and for some reason it's centering the window_frame?  



Weird things I notice:

I click on Dashboard, it comes up. 
i click on Family. It comes up. 
I click on Contact, it clears the Family button, but when I click on family again, nothing happens. 

I can't click on family first. I have to click on dashboard then family.  This is going to be annoying to debug. 

Fixed:  go_to_family() had the Family() instantiatiation incorrectly indented. -.-

Sunday:
